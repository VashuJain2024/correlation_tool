# Interactive Correlation Tool üìä

The **Interactive Correlation Tool** is a user-friendly web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It enables users to input two datasets, calculate their correlation coefficient, and visualize the relationship using a scatter plot.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Interactive Input**:
  - Users can input two datasets as comma-separated values.
- **Correlation Calculation**:
  - Computes the Pearson correlation coefficient between the datasets.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Displays a scatter plot of the input datasets for better understanding of their relationship.
- **Insights**:
  - Provides actionable insights based on the calculated correlation.

## How It Works üîç

1. **User Input**:
   - Users enter two datasets in the provided text areas (`Dataset X` and `Dataset Y`).
2. **Correlation Calculation**:
   - The `calculateCorrelation()` function computes the correlation coefficient using:
     \[
     r = \frac{\sum (x - \bar{x})(y - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum (x - \bar{x})^2 \sum (y - \bar{y})^2}}
     \]
3. **Scatter Plot**:
   - A scatter plot is generated using the provided data to visualize the relationship.
4. **Insights**:
   - Based on the correlation coefficient, insights about the data relationship (e.g., strong positive, weak negative) are displayed.
